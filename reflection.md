This assignment, like the last, showed me that my skills in Java are improving. Compared to earlier assignments, I had to rely on classmates, professors, tutors, and the internet a lot less. I was mostly able to fix issues on my own, using logic or error messages to understand what was going wrong. I think this is a good sign for this point in the course â€” I'm still not proficient, but I'm getting a lot better!

For the overloading in this assignment, I chose to do a mix of constructors and methods. For the house class, I only overloaded constructors, as I couldn't think of creative ways to overload other methods that still made sense given what I already had. I made it possible to initialize a house with students in it and to intialize a house without floors, a dining room, or an elevator. For the library cafe, I pushed myself to branch out from constructors. While I overloaded one constructor, I also included a printCollection() method that allows for the avaliability of a book to be shown. For the Cafe, my overloaded methods both relate to the inventory. One allows for a Cafe to be constructed at custom levels, while another allows for the inventory to be restocked to custom levels.
